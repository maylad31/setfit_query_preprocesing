# setfit_query_preprocessing

This repository implements a multi-head classifier using SetFit for query preprocessing, classifying queries into intent, domain, and human-in-the-loop (hitl) categories. 

## Why?

It is a preprocessing step, I don't feel the need for creating separate classifiers. So you have shared embeddings and multiple heads for each task which i think is efficient.

## Why query preprocessing?

I think for customer centric applications, analysing the query can be really crucial: decide where to route and what actions need to be taken, is the query relevant enough...

I am always open to interesting projects/opportunities and connecting with like minded people.
